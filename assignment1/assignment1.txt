1. Initial Thoughts

We aim to provide users with the ability to register and log in using the necessary credentials. Volunteers will 
be able to create personalized profiles that include details such as location, skills, preferences, and availability. 
They will also receive notifications from the web application about upcoming events and have the option to view 
their participation history and performance. Administrators, on the other hand, will have the capability to create 
and manage new events. The core features of this application include a login/registration system, profile and 
event management, a matchmaking system to pair volunteers with events, a notification system, and a section for 
users to review their volunteering history. The tech stack chosen for this application includes React for the 
frontend, Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

2. Development Methodology

I would use Agile for developing this app. Agile lets us build the app step by step, making it easy to adjust if the
non-profit's needs change. By working closely with the client, we can ensure the app matches their goals and get 
feedback regularly. This approach also allows us to release important features quickly, so the non-profit can start 
using the app sooner. Overall, Agile offers the flexibility and collaboration needed to create an app that truly helps 
manage and optimize volunteer activities.
